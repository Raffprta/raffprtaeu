# raffprtaeu

### Introduction
This is an open source of the rewrite of my [raffprta.eu](www.raffprta.eu) website. It functions as a generic lightweight 
blogging platform for my personal use however if you want to create a fork or contribute to this feel free, I plan to add 
more features to the site gradually.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository via `git clone https://github.com/Raffprta/raffprtaeu.git`
2. Ensure you have PHP installed, as well as an HTTP server and a Database system (Apache/MySQL recommended) 
3. Edit the `config.php` file to suit your local installation
4. Edit the `.htaccess` file to match the root directory you configured as all requests are routed to the index 
5. Ensure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed and run `composer install` in the root directory of your cloned repository.
6. This will inject the library dependancies needed to run raffprta.eu
7. You are ready to develop!
